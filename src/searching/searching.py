# TO-DO: Implement a recursive implementation of binary search
def binary_search(arr, target, start, end):
    #before base case, set start and end at start and end of array
    #these will narrow as we recurse

    #BASE CASE
    #if the midpoint is the target, return the target
    
    #RECURSIVE CASES
    #if the midpoint is less than the target, recurse on the right half

    #if the midpoint is greater than the target, recurse on the left half


# STRETCH: implement an order-agnostic binary search
# This version of binary search should correctly find 
# the target regardless of whether the input array is
# sorted in ascending order or in descending order
# You can implement this function either recursively 
# or iteratively
def agnostic_binary_search(arr, target):
    # Your code here
